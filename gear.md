## Bindings

### Burton Lexa Re:Flex Bindings
The Burton Lexa Snowboard Bindings are built for the hard charger, the ripper who's out there for the good and the bad, whether it's waist deep or boilerplate. They're built with stiff nylon composite Re:Flexâ„¢ baseplates, cushy FullBED footbeds to soak up impacts, and extra-responsive ankle and toe straps to keep you locked in tight, no matter how rowdy your ride gets. Just like you, they have the guts to perform no matter what the conditions hold, so grab the Lexas and get after it.
